This report is going to analysis the data collected from the Open Data Toronto about the evaluation of buildings in RentSafeTO program.

Through analying the dataset, we can find some information about the buildings which is used for renting. For example, the score of a building will give us a first impression; if a building has a high score, then it means the building is in a good position in every field, like security. In addition, we are looking forward to help people to find a good ward in Toronto to rent a house, if they want to live in Toronto. We mainly focus on the security score of buildings.

I also make one table and two graphs to help you get a clear view of the data.

Hope you enjoy my data :)
